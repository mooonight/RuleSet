# Preface 前言
- This is a repository of rule sets that apply for VPN applications like Loon and Surge. This means that the rules need to be otherwise **specified** after rule import or url subscription.
- 本仓库中的规则主要适配于Loon和Surged等网络代理软件，故导入或订阅规则后需要**额外写明分流类别**（如Direct、Proxy等）。

# Notes 说明
1. The rules are collected from the Internet with sources explicitly marked.
